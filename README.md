## Problem Statement

Airbnb provides a platform for hosts to accommodate guests with short-term lodging and tourism-related activities. Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, this data describes the listing activity & pricing of home-stays in Seattle & Boston. We are trying to see if there are any similarities or glaring differences in terms of listings and pricing over a years time
